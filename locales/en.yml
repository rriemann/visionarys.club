        ## Meet and discuss in informal atmosphere
        
        a debate club to open your mind
      definition: >
        The Visionary’s Club is a loosely organised forum of people from different
        origins and professions mostly living in Lyon, that meet once in a while to
        exchange their ideas, learn from each other and broaden their view.
      inter: >
        ##### interdisciplinary | international | intergenerational

        In order to enrich the encounters, we aim to integrate open minds
        that have made different experiences or think differently.

        That is why we seek to welcome people that pursued different
        formations in different countries. A priori, the debates will
        be held in French and English, but on request, this might be put to a
        vote.
      open: >
        ##### independent | tolerant | community-driven

        The encounters shall not be claimed by a political idea or a
        particular interest (least of all a financial one). There is
        not a need to agree on something. Apart from logistical aspects,
        the club is self-governed by its members. Therefore, the club
        endorses the principles of transparency and bottom-up decision-making.
        The encounters are not chaired in the hope that everyone is well-behaved.

        ## Locations
        
        cosy encounters right at your place
      text: >
        There is no office. The encounters are taking place in the apartments
        proposed by its members or outdoors. While the apartments offer only
        place for a limited number of participants,
        [Lyon’s Roman open-air theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Theatre_of_Fourvi%C3%A8re)
        has a comfortable size for about 10 000 people.
        
        However, we are in favour
        of small meetings, so that everyone gets the chance to get to known and talk
        to all other participants.

        ## Organisation
        
        private online community platform
      text: >
        To ease the organisation, a next-generation forum is made available to all known members.
        It is used to share *interesting* links, propose new topics, gather feed-back,
        find the next revenue and send invitations.
        
        To get access to the private forum, you need to receive an invitation from
        an existing member or get in contact with us, e.g. per
        [mail](mailto:mailto:mail@visionarys.club?subject=invitation).
        The forum is in fact part of a trial to provide a privacy-aware solution.
